# teletext-terminal-zdf
## General
As the name says, you can access the teletext of the german tv channel ZDF with this script. I wrote it inspired by [teletext-terminal-ard](https://github.com/AdamSchrey/teletext-terminal-ard). 
## How to run
Make sure you have a current version of ruby installed. I used [nokogiri](https://nokogiri.org/) for parsing the html. Install it:
```bash
gem install nokogiri
```
Run the application:
```bash
ruby zdf_teletext.rb
```
